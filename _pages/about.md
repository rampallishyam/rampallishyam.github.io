Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio!
======
I'm Shyam Sundar Rampalli, a passionate data scientist with over four years of experience in machine learning, transportation, and technical consulting. My journey has been driven by a curiosity to uncover insights from complex data and turn those into innovative solutions. I specialize in building and training machine learning models, conducting detailed data analyses, and developing simulations to tackle real-world challenges.

With a strong foundation in Python and hands-on experience in tools like PyTorch, Keras, and sci-kit learn, I focus on creating data-driven strategies that drive efficiency and accuracy. My work spans diverse areas, from developing traffic prediction algorithms to implementing cutting-edge models for vehicle detection and autonomous systems. My goal is to leverage my expertise in data science to contribute to meaningful projects that shape the future of industries and communities.

Whether you're a company looking to harness the power of data or tackle a specific problem, I'm here to collaborate and make data-driven decisions that lead to impactful results.
