# 1. License Plate and Face Anonymiser 

This project is designed to automatically detect and anonymize license plates and faces in images and videos. Anonymization is crucial for protecting personal privacy in various scenarios, such as surveillance footage, media sharing, and data handling.

## Project Goals

The primary goal of the License Plate and Face Anonymiser project is to provide an easy-to-use, reliable solution for anonymizing sensitive information in digital media. By automating the detection and anonymization process, the project aims to streamline workflows in various fields, from security to journalism, and ensure compliance with privacy standards.

## Technologies Used

- OpenCV
- Dlib
- PyTorch
- Yolo

# 2. Traffic Detection and Travel Time Estimation 

This project applies computer vision to identify a vehicle based on its type and then tracks whether it passed a certain location on a road stretch and following that outputs the number of vehicles that passed a cross section of the road by vehicle time and also estimate the travel time between two cross sections.

## Technologies Used

- OpenCV
- ByteTrack
- PyTorch
- Yolo

# 3. KNN classifier for cancer diagnosis data 

With an accuracy of 0.956 and an F1-score of 0.943, this KNN classifer classifies cancer diagnosis data whether it is malignant or benignant based on parameters such as radius_mean, perimeter_se, are_se, etc. 

## Technologies Used

- scikit-learn
