# License Plate and Face Anonymiser ![Project Logo](https://via.placeholder.com/100)

This project is designed to automatically detect and anonymize license plates and faces in images and videos. Anonymization is crucial for protecting personal privacy in various scenarios, such as surveillance footage, media sharing, and data handling.

## Overview

The License Plate and Face Anonymiser project leverages advanced computer vision techniques to identify and obscure sensitive information. By using machine learning models and image processing tools, the project can reliably detect and anonymize faces and license plates in digital media, ensuring privacy and compliance with data protection regulations.

### Key Features

- **Automatic Detection**: Uses trained models to identify license plates and faces with high accuracy.
- **Anonymization Techniques**: Employs blurring and other methods to effectively obscure detected areas without affecting the rest of the image or video.
- **Scalability**: Can process single images or videos, as well as batch process large datasets, making it suitable for various applications.

## Project Goals

The primary goal of the License Plate and Face Anonymiser project is to provide an easy-to-use, reliable solution for anonymizing sensitive information in digital media. By automating the detection and anonymization process, the project aims to streamline workflows in various fields, from security to journalism, and ensure compliance with privacy standards.

## Future Directions

- **Enhanced Detection Models**: Integrating more advanced machine learning models to improve detection accuracy under different conditions.
- **Customizable Anonymization**: Allowing users to choose different anonymization methods, such as pixelation or masking.
- **Real-time Processing**: Optimizing the application for real-time processing of video streams.
