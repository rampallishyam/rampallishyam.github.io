## ML projects

### 1. License Plate and Face Anonymiser 

This project is designed to automatically detect and anonymize license plates and faces in images and videos. Anonymization is crucial for protecting personal privacy in various scenarios, such as surveillance footage, media sharing, and data handling.

#### Technologies Used

- OpenCV
- Dlib
- PyTorch
- Yolo

Sample video here: [output_videos](https://github.com/rampallishyam/License-plate-and-face-anonymiser/tree/main/output_videos)

Entire repo here: [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rampallishyam/License-plate-and-face-anonymiser).

### 2. Traffic Detection and Travel Time Estimation 

This project applies computer vision to identify a vehicle based on its type and then tracks whether it passed a certain location on a road stretch and following that outputs the number of vehicles that passed a cross section of the road by vehicle time and also estimate the travel time between two cross sections.

#### Technologies Used

- OpenCV
- ByteTrack
- PyTorch
- Yolo

Entire repo here: [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rampallishyam/License-plate-and-face-anonymiser).


### 3. KNN classifier for cancer diagnosis data 

With an accuracy of 0.956 and an F1-score of 0.943, this KNN classifer classifies cancer diagnosis data whether it is malignant or benignant based on parameters such as radius_mean, perimeter_se, are_se, etc. 

#### Technologies Used

- scikit-learn

Entire repo here: [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rampallishyam/KNN-on-cancer-diagnosis-data/tree/main).

### 4. KNN classifier for diabetes data 

 This KNN classifer classifies whether a patient has diabetes or not based on the number of pregnancies, glucose, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin, BMI and diabetes pedigree function and age. 

#### Technologies Used

- scikit-learn

Entire repo here: [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rampallishyam/KNearestNeighbour-Classification-on-diabetes-data).
